OpenGraph for Java is a small class used to represent the Open Graph protocol (available from http://opengraphprotocol.org/)

This project is entirely open source due to the size of the code, so please go nuts and do whatever you want with the code.

Due to the lack of useful native DOM parsers this class implements the HTMLCleaner library (available at http://htmlcleaner.sourceforge.net/index.php), please find the license for it at the bottom of this readme. There is the hope to remove reliance on third party libraries at a later stage.
## Usage ##
In this example we will fetch the og:title and og:type contents, while ignoring any errors if this page does not comply with the Open Graph protocol standard (set in the constructor via true)

> `OpenGraph testPage = new OpenGraph("http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/1217700-kick_ass", true);`

> `String title = testPage.getContent("title");`

> `String type = testPage.getContent("type");`

Another example (available in the examples/ folder) demonstrates the support for custom OpenGraph namespaces

	OpenGraph movie = new OpenGraph("http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/back_to_the_future/", true);
	System.out.println("Movie: " + movie.getContent("title"));
	for (MetaElement director : movie.getProperties("director"))
	{
		OpenGraph extendedInfo = director.getExtendedData();
		System.out.println("Directed by: " + extendedInfo.getContent("title"));
	}

	for (MetaElement member : movie.getProperties("cast"))
	{
		OpenGraph extendedInfo = member.getExtendedData();
		System.out.println("Starring: " + extendedInfo.getContent("title"));
	}

## Features ##
* Uses the correct charset of the page during parsing (thanks to [rkhmelyuk](https://github.com/rkhmelyuk))
* Support's the ability for social applications to declare their own namespaces and OpenGraph meta
* Hashtable like representation of an Open Graph page
* Output to HTML (render the meta data back out as <meta> tags)
* Create OG data from scratch (the ability to use this class as a reverse and generate OG meta tags)
